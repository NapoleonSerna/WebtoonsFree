        <h6 style="color:white;">Rick, in a drunken state, takes his grandson, Morty, for a ride in his flying car and rambles on about how he plans to use a neutrino bomb to wipe out all life on Earth. Rick lands the vehicle on Morty's demand and passes out. The bomb activates by itself and seems to be left unchecked, but ultimately it is shown that life on Earth remains intact. After having breakfast with their family, Rick takes Morty to another dimension to collect seeds of "Mega Trees", which Morty is forced to hide in his own rectum to get past intergalactic customs. However, Rick and Morty's cover is blown and they escape while engaging in a shootout with alien insect soldiers. Ultimately, the seeds briefly cause Morty to be highly intelligent, despite the fact that he missed a semester of school because he's been in adventures with Rick. This causes his parents to believe he is fine with his education, but this wastes the seeds, so Rick informs Morty that they need to go back and get more, while their aftereffects leave Morty writhing on the floor.</h6>
